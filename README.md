**Django Custom Authentication Backend**
1. Create a New Authentication Backend
- In your Django project, create a new Python file for the custom backend (e.g., `backends.py`).
- Define a new class that inherits from `django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend`.
- Override the `authenticate` method to add logic for email/password and token-based authentication.
2. Implement Authentication Logic
- Inside the `authenticate` method, add logic to handle different authentication methods.
- For username/password and email/password, use Django's built-in `User` model to validate credentials.
- For token-based authentication, you might need to create a separate model (e.g., `AuthToken`) to store and validate tokens.
3. Update Django Settings
- In `settings.py`, add your custom backend to the `AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS` list.
4. Create API Endpoints
- Use Django REST Framework to create API endpoints for user authentication.
- These endpoints should accept the necessary credentials and use your custom backend for authentication.

CI/CD Pipeline
1. Version Control
- Use a version control system like Git. Push your code to a repository on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
2. Continuous Integration (CI)
- Use a CI tool like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI.
- Configure the CI tool to automatically run tests whenever code is pushed to the repository.
- Set up linting, unit tests, and integration tests.

Dockerizing the Django Application
1. Create a Dockerfile
- Write a `Dockerfile` for your Django application.
- Include steps to install dependencies, copy your project files, and set the necessary environment variables.
2. Build the Docker Image
- Use `docker build` to create an image of your Django application.
3. Run the Container
- Use `docker run` to start a container based on your image.
4. Docker Compose (Optional)
- If your application requires services like a database, use Docker Compose to define and run multi-container Docker applications.
